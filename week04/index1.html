        preferred way to link a css file to html
        it can also be done inline as attributes, e.g. style="color:red" and other ways,
        but this way we mix the html and the css, i.e. structure/semantics vs style
        moreover, it would be more complex to find inside the html document the style 
        -->
        <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">

    <body>
        <!-- 
        h1 = title of level 1: there are 6 levels
        NB: it is allowed to skip some levels of heading,
        but it gives a validation error 
        NB: html is about the structure and the semantics of
        the structure, not about the appearance
         => the size of the text isn't directly related 
         => h1 is only the most important heading
        NB: each browser has a different default stylesheet for html i.e. the user agent stylesheet
         => writing css overrides the default style
        NB: with inspect element, we can change temporarily => it doesn't change the actual html document
        -->
        <header>
            <!--
            header doesn't change the default style, but we can style differently header from body
